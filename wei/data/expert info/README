The filenames that contain tp are the true positive craters. Also known
as the ground truth.

The filenames that contain tn are crater candidates created by
Lourenco's highlight/shadow method but are not craters.

Each file has the columns x,y,r where:

x center of crater measured from the left side of image
y center of crater measured from the top of image
r radius of crater

These will map to the images when they are 1700x1700 pixels.
